                    Himachal Pradesh is synonymous with scenic beauty, serene landscape, and adventure sports.
                    Literally, Himachal means “the land of snow”. Situated in the western Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh has
                    several hill stations which are the most appropriate destination to find respite from the scorching
                    summer heat.
