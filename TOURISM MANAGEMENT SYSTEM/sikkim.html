                    Sikkim is the paradise nestled in the North-East part of India with the magnetic views of the great
                    Himalayas. If you havenâ€™t thought of exploring the beauty of this magnificent state then you are
                    truly missing on something really beautiful. Sikkim is like wonders in a small package with
                    bewitching meadows, snowcapped and sky-piercing Himalayas, and the mesmeric charm of its vibrant
                    culture.
