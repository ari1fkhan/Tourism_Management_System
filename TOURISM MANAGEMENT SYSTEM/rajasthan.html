                    republic of India. It covers an area of 342,239 sq kilometers which is 10.4% of India. However
                    despite
                    of its large size it is covered by the Great Indian Desert, Thar. The Thar Desert runs parallel to
                    the
                    Sutlej-Indus river valley. Being located at the forefront of Indian civilization, the state of
                    Rajasthan
                    has seen the age of kings thus, explaining the moniker ‘the land of kings’. Rajasthan houses an
                    amazing
                    display of arts and architecture, courtesy of it being a princely state.
