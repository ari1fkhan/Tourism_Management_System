                    From the colonial ambiance and architecture of Rajkot to historical sites like Lothal that date back
                    to the Indus Valley civilisation, ultra-modern cities like Ahmedabad, ancient Hindu cities like
                    Dwarka, and jaw-dropping architectural feats like the Sardar Sarovar Dam, the list of places to
                    visit in Gujarat is long and super-exciting!
                    The stupendous places to see in Gujarat have put the state on the world map of ‘the extraordinary’.
                    Be it the Statue of Unity, which is the tallest statue in the world, the 10th-century stepwell of
                    Rani ki Vav, the majestic Somnath Temple, or the 4000-year-old erstwhile Harappan city of Dholavira,
                    the choices are endless.
