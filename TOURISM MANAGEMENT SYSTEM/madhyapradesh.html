                    Madhya Pradesh, in central India, draws visitors with well-preserved remnants of its compelling
                    history. Its many abandoned cities provide an intriguing window to the past, so different from the
                    congested India of today. In further contrast, the national parks of Madhya Pradesh offer some of
                    India's best jungle lodges and wildlife spotting opportunities. Here are the top Madhya Pradesh
                    tourist places.
